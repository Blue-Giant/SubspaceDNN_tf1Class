# Requirement for SubspaceDNN 
The codes are implemented in tensorflow--1.14 or 1.15 under the interpreter python3.6 or python3.7.  Additionally, if the codes are runned on a Server, one should use the miniconda3 for python 3.7 or 3.6. However, if you dowmload the latest version of miniconda3 from https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh, you will get a miniconda3 based on python 3.8.  Hence, you should redirect to the https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html, then download the miniconda3 based on python3.7.

The original codes are found in https://github.com/Blue-Giant/MscaleDNN_tf1
