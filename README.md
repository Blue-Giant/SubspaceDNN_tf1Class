# Requirement for SubspaceDNN 
The codes are implemented in tensorflow--1.14 or 1.15 under the interpreter python3.6 or python3.7.  Additionally, if the codes are runned on a Server, one should use the miniconda3 for python 3.7 or 3.6. However, if you dowmload the latest version of miniconda3 from https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh, you will get a miniconda3 based on python 3.8.  Hence, you should redirect to the https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html, then download the miniconda3 based on python3.7.

The original codes are found in https://github.com/Blue-Giant/SubspaceDNN_tf1

## Abstract
While deep learning algorithms demonstrate a great potential in scientific computing, its application to multi-scale problems remains to be a big challenge. This is manifested by the ``frequency principle"  that neural networks tend to learn low frequency components first. Novel architectures such as multi-scale deep neural network (MscaleDNN) were proposed to alleviate this problem to some extent. In this paper, we construct a subspace decomposition based DNN (dubbed SD$^2$NN) architecture for a class of multi-scale problems by combining MscaleDNN algorithms with traditional numerical analysis ideas. The proposed architecture includes one low frequency normal DNN submodule, and one (or a few) high frequency MscaleDNN submodule(s), which are designed to capture the smooth part and the oscillatory part of the multi-scale solutions simultaneously. We demonstrate that the SD$^2$NN outperforms existing models such as MscaleDNN, through several benchmark multi-scale problems in regular or perforated domains.
